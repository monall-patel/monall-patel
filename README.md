## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **full-stack engineer** focused on **security-first architecture**, **data integrity**, and **research-grade validation systems**.

My work lives at the intersection of:
- **Backend determinism**
- **Cryptographic correctness**
- **Detectability-aware systems**
- **Clean, premium user experience**

I don’t chase trends — I engineer **systems that hold up under scrutiny**.

---

## 🧭 Professional Journey

- Designed and implemented **secure offline-first systems** for real-world business constraints  
- Built **end-to-end encrypted pipelines** with reproducibility and validation guarantees  
- Architected **FastAPI backends** with modular, auditable workflows  
- Developed **React-based interfaces** with a premium, minimal, research-oriented aesthetic  
- Worked deeply with **signal integrity, encryption, validation, and stealth evaluation**

My approach is **methodical, measurable, and performance-driven**.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

> **“If it cannot be validated, it cannot be trusted.”**

I believe:
- Security must be **designed**, not added
- Performance must be **measured**, not assumed
- Code should read like **engineering documentation**
- Systems should fail **predictably and transparently**
